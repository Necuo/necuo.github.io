      <description>Intro note Oh shit, Birthday day! Dear Meltem aka Queen Elizabeth,
I have been thinking&amp;hellip;
What would be the best gift to make you online?
After imagining many options, some of them involving sending Mikhail to Turkey just to carry some more candies for you, I decided that I wanted to made something different.
It would be so easy to buy something and send you to your home, but you know&amp;hellip; my second name is hard.</description>

      <description>Small Thinking Sometimes in life, we are not aware of decisions or things that lead us to huge new experiences or changes. Even when meeting people, they only cross our ways and we let them enter, pass and forget. It’s more difficult to build a one-to-one connection that’s stable across time than to meet new people. I think you also as a valuable person, someone who is curious and let that curiosness enter.</description>
