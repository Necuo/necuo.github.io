      <description>Dear Meltem Picasso,
Ok so the fact that you found some field that you want and be able to spend a ton of time doing and improving it’s actually a life-goal accomplished in itself.
Finding some time to create something artsy out of nothing is one of the best human skills someone could have. Art is a channel for something beyond us, it is lovely. I admire and encourage you to keep doing it if that’s what you love.</description>

      <description>In Summary Happy birthday Meltem!!!!!!!!
I wish you the best, have fun today and also all the rest of your life :)
I appreciate you and I appreciate your fcking existence.
Sincerely.
Pablocito,
 BONUS! And because you’re a good soul that I enjoy to talk with, in other words, you’re my friend. And because we are in a science based society (ZzzzZzZ) I have to deliver some proofs-of-friendship.
And what says more than an image?</description>
